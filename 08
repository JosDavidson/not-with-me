The objective to working with remote repositories on local machine

Step 1: Install Git

●	Download the Git installer from the official Git website.
●	Run the installer and follow the step-by-step instructions in the setup wizard. ● Make sure to select the appropriate options during the installation process.
Step 2: Configure Git

●	Open a terminal or command prompt.
●	Set your username and email address by running the following commands: git config --global user.name "Your Name" git config -global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Step 3: Set up the default branch name (optional)

●	By default, Git creates a branch called "master" when you initialize a new repository with
`git init`.
●	If you prefer to use a different name for the initial branch, you can set it using the following command:
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

●	This command sets the default branch name to "main". Replace "main" with your preferred branch name if desired.





Step 4: Verify
your Git configuration

●	To check your Git configuration settings, you can use the following command: git config

--list

●	This command will display a list of your Git configuration settings, including your username and email address.
●		These steps should help you set up and configure Git on your local machine. Remember to replace "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your own information. ● Working with Remote Repository
